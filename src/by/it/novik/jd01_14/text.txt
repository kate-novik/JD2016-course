Is it possible to live without traveling? Probably yes, but very difficult.
Millions of people travel around the world just for fun.
Travels broaden the mind, make a person be more friendly and open.
Journeys could be made in different ways.
You might travel by plane, by bus, by rail or by your own car.
As for me, I'm just crazy about travelling by sea.
I believe that this voyage gives you a lot of unforgettable emotions and impressions.
If you make for the open sea by ferry, in this case you have a wonderful opportunity
to see the depth of the sea, the purity of water and living marine animals in all their beauty.
Besides, a good opportunity arises - swimming in pure water.
Nevertheless, I do not like jellyfish too much and at any case try to avoid their presence.
